### Info of files 
- **[main.py](https://github.com/JigarJoshi04/Calculator/blob/master/main.py)** This is the heart of the project. It inherits the functionalities from operations file and performs operation on the two numbers entered by the user.

- **[operations.py](https://github.com/JigarJoshi04/Calculator/blob/master/operations.py)** In this file we define the functions to perform operations as per requirement. 


### Guidelines to start Contribution :computer:
